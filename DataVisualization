I worked on this project where I used pandas to handle data and matplotlib and/or seaborn to visualize it.
In this project, I took a second look at two cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum.
In the first problem, I revisited the cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum. After that, I focused on visualizing the price fluctuations of Bitcoin throughout the year 2021.
Initially, I plotted the price development as it is.
Then, I aimed to extract data specifically from Mondays using the pandas day_name method, which provides the weekday from a date.
I created a data frame containing only data from Mondays and plotted the closing price evolution. I marked positive price changes between two weeks in green and negative changes in red.
I also created a dataframe with indicators for price ups and downs and grouped them into blocks. I visualized these ups and downs separately.
To compare Bitcoin and Ethereum, I constructed a grid displaying histograms of their closing prices and scatterplots with regression lines.
Lastly, I repeated the graph from part (c) but focused on the differences in closing prices between consecutive days.
